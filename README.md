## About

Designed with Android Lifecycle in mind, it delivers a simple and efficient app experience. In general, a **simple and efficient compass**

> Most compass apps are either too basic or bloated with ads.  
> **MBCompass** was created to fix that — lightweight, accurate, and totally ad-free.
