## About

**MBCompass** is a modern, free, and open-source compass and navigation app without **ads**, **IAP**, or **tracking**. Built with Jetpack Compose, it supports compass and navigation features while being **lightweight** and simple.

> Not just a compass. Not a map app.
>
> MBCompass bridges the gap between a **compass** and a **full navigation app** - shows direction and live location without using hundreds of MBs of storage or privacy trade-offs.
